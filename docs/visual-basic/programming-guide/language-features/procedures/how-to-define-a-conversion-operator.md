# How to: Define a Conversion Operator (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../../visual-basic/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

If you have defined a class or structure, you can define a type conversion operator between the type of your class or structure and another data type (such as `Integer`, `Double`, or `String`).  
  
 Define the type conversion as a [CType Function](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/ctype-function.md) procedure within the class or structure. All conversion procedures must be `Public Shared`, and each one must specify either [Widening](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/widening.md) or [Narrowing](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/narrowing.md).  
  
 Defining an operator on a class or structure is also called *overloading* the operator.  
  
## Example  
 The following example defines conversion operators between a structure called `digit` and a `Byte`.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#27](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/codesnippet/visualbasic/how-to-define-a-conversi_1.vb)]  
  
 You can test the structure `digit` with the following code.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#28](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/codesnippet/visualbasic/how-to-define-a-conversi_2.vb)]
