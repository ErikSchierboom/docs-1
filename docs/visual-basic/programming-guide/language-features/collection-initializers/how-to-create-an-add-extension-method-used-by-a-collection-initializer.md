# How to: Create an Add Extension Method Used by a Collection Initializer (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../../visual-basic/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

When you use a collection initializer to create a collection, the Visual Basic compiler searches for an `Add` method of the collection type for which the parameters for the `Add` method match the types of the values in the collection initializer. This `Add` method is used to populate the collection with the values from the collection initializer.  
  
 If no matching `Add` method exists and you cannot modify the code for the collection, you can add an extension method called `Add` that takes the parameters that are required by the collection initializer. This is typically what you need to do when you use collection initializers for generic collections.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows how to add an extension method to the generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> type so that a collection initializer can be used to add objects of type `Employee`. The extension method enables you to use the shortened collection initializer syntax.
