# &#39;Is&#39; requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../visual-basic/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The `Is` comparison operator determines whether two object variables refer to the same instance. This comparison is not defined for value types.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30020  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Use the appropriate arithmetic comparison operator or the `Like` operator to compare two value types.
