# File is too large to read into a byte array
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../visual-basic/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

The size of the file you are attempting to read into a byte array exceeds 4 GB. The `My.Computer.FileSystem.ReadAllBytes` method cannot read a file that exceeds this size.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Use a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> to read the file. For more information, see [Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/basics-of-.net-framework-file-i-o-and-the-file-system-visual-basic.md).
