# &#39;#ElseIf&#39; must be preceded by a matching &#39;#If&#39; or &#39;#ElseIf&#39;
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../../../visual-basic/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

`#ElseIf` is a conditional compilation directive. An `#ElseIf` clause must be preceded by a matching `#If` or `#ElseIf` clause.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30014  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Check that a preceding `#If` or `#ElseIf` has not been separated from this `#ElseIf` by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`.  
  
2.  If the `#ElseIf` is preceded by a `#Else` directive, either remove the `#Else` or change it to an `#ElseIf`.  
  
3.  If everything else is in order, add an `#If` directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block.
