# /fullpaths (C# Compiler Options)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The **/fullpaths** option causes the compiler to specify the full path to the file when listing compilation errors and warnings.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
/fullpaths  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 By default, errors and warnings that result from compilation specify the name of the file in which an error was found. The **/fullpaths** option causes the compiler to specify the full path to the file.  
  
 This compiler option is unavailable in Visual Studio and cannot be changed programmatically.
