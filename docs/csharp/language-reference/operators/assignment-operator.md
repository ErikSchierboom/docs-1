# = Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The assignment operator (`=`) stores the value of its right-hand operand in the storage location, property, or indexer denoted by its left-hand operand and returns the value as its result. The operands must be of the same type (or the right-hand operand must be implicitly convertible to the type of the left-hand operand).  
  
## Remarks  
 The assignment operator cannot be overloaded. However, you can define implicit conversion operators for a type, which enable you to use the assignment operator with those types. For more information, see [Using Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/using-conversion-operators.md).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#49](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#49)]
