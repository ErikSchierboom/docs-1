# %= Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The remainder assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `%=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```  
x %= y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```  
x = x % y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [% operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/modulus-operator.md) is predefined for numeric types to compute the remainder after division.  
  
 The `%=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [% operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/modulus-operator.md) (see [operator (C# Reference)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)).  
  
## Example
