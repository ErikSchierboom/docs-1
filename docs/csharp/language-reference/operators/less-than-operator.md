# &lt; Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

All numeric and enumeration types define a "less than" relational operator (`<`) that returns `true` if the first operand is less than the second, `false` otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `<` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)). If `<` is overloaded, [>](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/greater-than-operator.md) must also be overloaded. When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#24](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#24)]
