# *= Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The binary multiplication assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `*=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```  
x *= y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```  
x = x * y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [* operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/multiplication-operator.md) is predefined for numeric types to perform multiplication.  
  
 The `*=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [* operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/multiplication-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)).
