# ^= Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The exclusive-OR assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression of the form  
  
```  
x ^= y  
```  
  
 is evaluated as  
  
```  
x = x ^ y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [^ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/xor-operator.md) performs a bitwise exclusive-OR operation on integral operands and logical exclusive-OR on [bool](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/bool.md) operands.  
  
 The ^= operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [^ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/xor-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)).  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#23](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#23)]
