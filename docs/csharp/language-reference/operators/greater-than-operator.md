# &gt; Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

All numeric and enumeration types define a "greater than" relational operator (`>`) that returns `true` if the first operand is greater than the second, `false` otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `>` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)). If `>` is overloaded, [<](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/less-than-operator.md) must also be overloaded. When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#29](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#29)]
