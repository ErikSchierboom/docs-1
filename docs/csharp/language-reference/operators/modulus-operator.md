# % Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The `%` operator computes the remainder after dividing its first operand by its second. All numeric types have predefined remainder operators.  
  
## Remarks  
 User-defined types can overload the `%` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)). When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#9](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#9)]  
  
## Comments  
 Note the round-off errors associated with the double type.
