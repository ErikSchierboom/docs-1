# -&gt; Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The `->` operator combines pointer dereferencing and member access.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression of the form,  
  
```  
x->y  
```  
  
 (where `x` is a pointer of type `T*` and `y` is a member of `T`) is equivalent to,  
  
```  
(*x).y  
```  
  
 The `->` operator can be used only in code that is marked as [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md).  
  
 The `->` operator cannot be overloaded.  
  
## Example  
 [!code-cs[csRefOperators#15](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/csharp/csrefOperators/csrefOperators.cs#15)]
