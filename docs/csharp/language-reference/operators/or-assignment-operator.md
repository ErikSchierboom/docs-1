# |= Operator (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

The OR assignment operator.  
  
## Remarks  
 An expression using the `|=` assignment operator, such as  
  
```  
x |= y  
```  
  
 is equivalent to  
  
```  
x = x | y  
```  
  
 except that `x` is only evaluated once. The [&#124; operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/or-operator.md) performs a bitwise logical OR operation on integral operands and logical OR on bool operands.  
  
 The `|=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [&#124; operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/or-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator-csharp-reference.md)).  
  
## Example
