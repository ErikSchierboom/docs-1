# C# Preprocessor Directives
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

This section contains information about the following C# preprocessor directives.  
  
 [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md)  
  
 [#else](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md)  
  
 [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md)  
  
 [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md)  
  
 [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md)  
  
 [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md)  
  
 [#warning](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-warning.md)  
  
 [#error](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-error.md)

 [#region](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-region.md)  
  
 [#endregion](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endregion.md)  
  
 [#pragma](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-pragma.md)  
  
 [#pragma warning](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-pragma-warning.md)  
  
 [#pragma checksum](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-pragma-checksum.md)  
  
 See the individual topics for more information and examples.  
  
 Although the compiler does not have a separate preprocessor, the directives described in this section are processed as if there were one. They are used to help in conditional compilation. Unlike C and C++ directives, you cannot use these directives to create macros.  
  
 A preprocessor directive must be the only instruction on a line.
