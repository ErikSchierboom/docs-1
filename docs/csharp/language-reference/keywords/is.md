# is (C# Reference)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

Checks if an object is compatible with a given type. For example, the following code can determine if an object is an instance of the `MyObject` type, or a type that derives from `MyObject`:  
  
```  
if (obj is MyObject)  
{  
}  
```  
  
 An `is` expression evaluates to `true` if the provided expression is non-null, and the provided object can be cast to the provided type without causing an exception to be thrown.  
  
 The `is` keyword causes a compile-time warning if the expression is known to always be `true` or to always be `false`, but typically evaluates type compatibility at run time.  
  
 The `is` operator cannot be overloaded.  
  
 Note that the `is` operator only considers reference conversions, boxing conversions, and unboxing conversions. Other conversions, such as user-defined conversions, are not considered.  
  
 Anonymous methods are not allowed on the left side of the `is` operator. This exception includes lambda expressions.
