# How to: Query a Collection of Objects (C# Programming Guide)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

This example shows how to perform a simple query over a list of `Student` objects. Each `Student` object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations.  
  
 This application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same `students` data source.  
  
## Example  
 The following query returns the students who received a score of 90 or greater on their first exam.  
  
 [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#15](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/csharp/csLINQProgRef/csrefLINQHowTos.cs#15)]  
  
 This query is intentionally simple to enable you to experiment. For example, you can try more predicates in the `where` clause, or use an `orderby` clause to sort the results.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
  
-   Create a [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5. By default, the project has a reference to System.Core.dll and a `using` directive for the System.Linq namespace.  
  
-   Copy the code into your project.  
  
-   Press F5 to compile and run the program.  
  
-   Press any key to exit the console window.
