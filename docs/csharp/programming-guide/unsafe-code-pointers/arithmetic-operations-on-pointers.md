# Arithmetic Operations on Pointers (C# Programming Guide)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

This topic discusses using the arithmetic operators `+` and **-** to manipulate pointers.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot perform any arithmetic operations on void pointers.  
  
## Adding and Subtracting Numeric Values to or From Pointers  
 You can add a value `n` of type [int](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/int.md), [uint](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/uint.md), [long](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/long.md), or [ulong](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ulong.md) to a pointer, `p`,of any type except `void*`. The result `p+n` is the pointer resulting from adding `n * sizeof(p) to the address of p`. Similarly, `p-n` is the pointer resulting from subtracting `n * sizeof(p)` from the address of `p`.  
  
## Subtracting Pointers  
 You can also subtract pointers of the same type. The result is always of the type `long`. For example, if `p1` and `p2` are pointers of the type `pointer-type*`, then the expression `p1-p2` results in:  
  
 `((long)p1 - (long)p2)/sizeof(pointer_type)`  
  
 No exceptions are generated when the arithmetic operation overflows the domain of the pointer, and the result depends on the implementation.
