# How to: Write to a Text File (C# Programming Guide)
[!INCLUDE[csharpbanner](../../../csharp/includes/csharpbanner.md)]

These examples show various ways to write text to a file.  The first two examples use static convenience methods on the <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName> class to write each element of any IEnumerable\<string> and a string to a text file.  Example 3 shows how to add text to a file when you have to process each line individually as you write to the file.  Examples 1-3 overwrite all existing content in the file, but example 4 shows you how to append text to an existing file.  
  
 These examples all write string literals to files, but more likely you will want to use the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method, which has many controls for writing different types of values  right or left justified in a field, with or without padding, and so on.  You can also use the C# [string interpolation](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings.md) feature.

## Robust Programming  
 The following conditions may cause an exception:  
  
-   The file exists and is read-only.  
  
-   The path name may be too long.  
  
-   The disk may be full.
