# Compiler Error CS0013
Unexpected error writing metadata to file 'ModelStore.dll' -- 'No logical space left to create more user strings.  
  
 The .NET Framework common language runtime did not emit metadata. Check to make sure that the path is correct and that the disk is not full. If the problem persists, you may have to repair or reinstall [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../csharp/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and/or the .NET Framework.
