# Compiler Error CS0544
'property override': cannot override because 'non-property' is not a property  
  
 An attempt was made to override a nonproperty data type as a [property](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), which is not allowed.  
  
 The following sample generates CS0544:  
  
```  
// CS0544.cs  
// compile with: /target:library  
public class a  
{  
   public int i;  
}  
  
public class b : a  
{  
   public override int i {   // CS0544  
   // try the following line instead  
   // public new int i {  
      get  
      {  
         return 0;  
      }  
   }  
}  
```
